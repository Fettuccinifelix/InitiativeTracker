Pet project I'm working on to be used for my upcoming Dungeons and Dragons campaign. The project uses the RC522 RFID Reader Writer Module and 13.56 MHz RFID tags embedded in the base of the miniatures to keep track of player and monster initiative and health points. 

As of 5/19/2025, it works completely out of a CLI, but I would like to develop some web interface
